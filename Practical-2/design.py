# values are distinct and not repeated
    # ask for user input aka modification moves, then store moves into a list of strings
        # the last element of that list will indicate which order the AVL tree should be printed in
        # for other moves, e.g., A3, D4
            # the letter "A" and "D" are short for "Add" and "Delete"
            # follow each letter is the value of the node to be added or deleted
                # e.g., A3 means to add 3 to the tree

    # helper function to add value

    # helper function to delete value
        # delete a leaf
        # delete a node with 1 child
        # delete a node with 2 children

    # HELPER FUNCTION TO TURN AN ORDINARY BST INTO AN AVL TREE

    # helper functions to traverse the entire tree and print out all values - DONE
        # inorder
        # preorder
        # postorder

    # hmm maybe make one traverse function only - DONE
